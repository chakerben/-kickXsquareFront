Jumpman joined the Space Hippie movement to release an eco-friendly classic with the Jordan 1 High Zoom Crater, now available on StockX. The Crater moniker not only comes from the colorway�s otherworldly appearance, but also because of the Crater Foam, a sustainable cushioning system made of Grind Rubber and foam, that is found in each shoe's midsole.\n\nThe Jordan 1 Zoom Crater features a black and grey upper that is composed primarily of recycled materials. Red stitching accents along the heel stand out from the muted silhouette, adding another dimension that is often lost in monotone colorways. Exposed foam on the ankle lining, a white speckled midsole, and a multicolor outsole composed of Nike Grind and �space junk� materials add the finishing touches to this updated marvel.\n\nThese sneakers released in September of 2020 and retailed for $175.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"zoom-crater"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1017932383"]}
