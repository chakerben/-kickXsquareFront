The two entities have made their collaborative efforts consistent since first releasing the Jordan 5 PSG in 2018. Following that, Jordan 6 and Jordan 4 models were stamped with the PSG insignia, leading to a fresh spin on the Jordan 1.\n\nThe Jordan 1 Zoom Air CMFT Paris Saint-Germain features an off-white and black Durabuck upper with a reflective iridescent cut-out Swoosh located on each lateral side. A purple and pink gradient textile wraps the ankle, with a similar gradient filling in the Wings logo on the ankle.

Lastly, a white midsole and black outsole complete the design in traditional Jordan 1 fashion.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 Zoom PSG released in February of 2021 and retailed for $140.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"psg-paris-saint-germain"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1017932383"]}
