After teasing the release of the Off-White 4 with samples in his MCA exhibit and presenting them in his Off-White FW2020 Women�s Show, Virgil Abloh finally delivered what might be the most anticipated release of 2020. The Air Jordan 4 Sail features full-grain leather uppers with hits of mesh and translucent materials on the toebox and heel of the shoe. From there, hits of light blue on the tongue�s Jumpman and the outsole�s Nike Swoosh provide contrast to the sail colored sneaker. These women's sneakers released in July of 2020 and retailed for $200 USD.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"off-white-sail-w"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1017932383"]}
