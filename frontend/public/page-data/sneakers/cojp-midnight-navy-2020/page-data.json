Jordan Brand revived another colorway from the 2001 Jordan 1 CO.JP Pack with the Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy. The original Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy first released as a Japanese exclusive in 2001. With only 3,000 pairs produced, the 2001 Navy CO.JP is one of the rarest Jordan 1 releases of all time. Now, for the first time in almost two decades, the Midnight Navy CO.JP made a return.\n\nDressed in white tumbled leather, navy suede overlays, and a silver Swoosh, the Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy holds many of the same attributes as the OG. The only point of difference between this 2020 iteration and the OG is that the 2020 pair features classic Nike branding on the tongue instead of the traditional Jumpman embroidery. A sail midsole, navy outsole, and bubble Wings logo on the ankle complete the throwback design.\n\nThe Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy released in November of 2020 and retailed for $170.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"cojp-midnight-navy-2020"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1017932383"]}
