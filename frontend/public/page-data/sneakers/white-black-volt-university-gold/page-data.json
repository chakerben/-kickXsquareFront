The Volt Gold offers a new take on the renowned Black Toe theme by implementing new materials and features that contribute to a reconstructed design aesthetic.\n\nIn familiar Black Toe color blocking, the upper of the Jordan 1 Volt Gold is composed of white, black, and yellow leather. A Volt yellow-tinted panel donning the Jordan Wings logo wraps the ankle. Unlike OG Jordan 1 designs that feature double stitch reinforcement, the Volt Gold utilizes single stitch reinforcement on its overlays, creating dimensionality with exposed edges. A nylon tongue with exposed foam edges and reverse transparent tongue label emphasize Jordanï¿½s reconstructed design approach. A yellowed midsole and black outsole offer an aged look.\n\nThe Jordan 1 High Volt Gold released in January of 2021 and retailed for $170.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"white-black-volt-university-gold"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1017932383"]}
